# KNN Regression: California Housing Prices

A portfolio project showcasing K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) regression using Scikit-learn to predict house prices in California. This project demonstrates advanced machine learning techniques, including feature engineering, pipeline automation, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation, with engaging visualizations.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Raw and processed datasets (fetched via Scikit-learn)
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, modeling, and evaluation
- `images/`: Static visualizations for documentation

## Dataset
California Housing Prices dataset (~20,600 samples, 8 features) from Scikit-learn, predicting median house values based on features like median income, house age, and location.
